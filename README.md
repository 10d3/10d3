### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Herley**](https://amherley.dev), a fullstack dev.

I enjoy working with APIs, clean architecture, and building things that are fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.

Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me watching anime like _**Attack on Titan**_ or _**Berserk**_, sketching, or enjoying a cup of coffee with _profiterole_ (yes, it’s as good as it sounds).

##3 A few random facts:

- I’m all about dark, emotional anime
- Coffee + pastries = happiness
- Coding at night just feels right
